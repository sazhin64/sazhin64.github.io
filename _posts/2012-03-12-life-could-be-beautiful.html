<p><strong><&#47;strong>&ldquo;Life Could Be Beautiful!&rdquo; I ponder on the meaning of that phrase while sitting in the kitchen of our small summer log cabin. Not a big kitchen, just a corner separated by drapes. Nothing out of the ordinary. The whole cabin is nothing be jealous about: It is just our summer hideout, where mother and I spend the warm season.</p>
<p>Some gifts lie on table in front of me. They are presents to my mother from an older woman who lives nearby. Three mugs made out of plastic, colored pink, with an inscription reading, &ldquo;Life Could Be Beautiful!&rdquo; I read it and my mood suddenly changed for the better.</p>
<p>My life changed for the better, too, since that time. I use one of those mugs to drink tea every day. They make me remember that life may indeed be beautiful. If I sit on a wooden stool and I begin to feel blue, I recall my pink mug with that encouraging phrase on and I feel better. Is it life really that beautiful?</p>
<p>My neighbor&rsquo;s wife was arrested the day before. She had stabbed her husband. They were drinking and a nasty argument followed suit. After the incident, their children were picked up by some relatives. My neighbor did not die. He sits alone and drinks like there is no tomorrow: He does not know that, &ldquo;Life is Beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The husband of my other neighbor by leaving her took happiness from her life. He took the TV set and a DVD player, too. Now she stays by herself with 5 children. Her husband went back to his mother, just 100 meters away. I may be more concerned about her life than she is. I wonder if there is a pink mug on her table, too.</p>
<p>From time to time, a young divorc&eacute;e comes to visit us. She holds a young son. She unloads with mother, and takes mother&rsquo;s gifts. She lives with alcoholic parents &mdash; no money, no food in the fridge. The fence in the neighboring house fell, but her deep sadness does not fall off from their minds. They, too, may have pink mugs. However, there is no emotion, no sorrow in their broken life!</p>
<p>I remember about mother&rsquo;s friend &ndash; an old woman with about 20 years of penury. She can feel her hands but cannot walk. I feel horror about a miserable life like that.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t imagine what disabled people suffer, unable to walk, run or even care for themselves.</p>
<p>My mother decided to give that woman something to uplift her spirit. I offered to buy her a radio. That may broaden her world now so narrow.</p>
<p>She was so happy after she got our gift. Tears ran down her cheeks. &ldquo;Life Could Be Beautiful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I lie on the couch and brought old pictures from the past into my mind &ndash; a bright landscape, a field with berries or neighboring people. I ask myself, &ldquo;What did I do wrong that so many unfortunate people live nearby? Why there is so much unhappiness around me?</p>
<p>I have ideas how to better life but I have no money for global projects. I could buy a few dozens of pink mugs and with them give my neighbors hope, by telling them that, &ldquo;Life Could Be Beautiful!&rdquo;</p>
