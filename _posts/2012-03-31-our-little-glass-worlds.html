Do you remember, Vova, when you were just a schoolboy in primary school? We dedicated spring days to activities in our urban environment, waiting for summer vacation, which we spent in our village. In our days off we used to walk through and around a garden nearby. We took with us is a butterfly net and a glass jar.<br />
There was a small patch of pine forest located near city, where we also walked every warm day or evening we were lucky to have. People from our whole district used to go there to relax from the fatigues of our daily life. Today everyone has a car and drives everywhere he wants. Now you only see maybe a solitary old man or a couple of seniors during the entire day.<br />
We have no serious aim in our hiking, except for watching tiny beetles or enchanting butterflies, while carefully finding out which plant was edible or poisonous. You needed, too, to be exposed to a little healthy sunshine.<br />
I had a professional interest for insects, accompanied by a yearning for acquiring new knowledge. I wanted so much to imprint this interest for knowledge into you, my son.<br />
I can&rsquo;t tell into how many places we stuck our noses at that time like those rotten tree barks with longhorn beetles crawling inside. We snooped in old wells, which have become like natural traps for ground beetles. We dig out dung beetles from manure, and observed fungus beetles in their own environment. Such happy times they were!<br />
Then there was a difficult period of time &mdash; economic crisis or public assassinations. Our walking helped us survive the chaos caused by &ldquo;rebuilding&rdquo; our society. One bookstore went bankrupt and sold books as paper waste. In a pile of disposed-of books I saw one, brightly colored. It was a guide to identify and classifying insects. It was an excellent catalog for entomologists. Its bright cover and paintings were a treasure. The horned nose beetle was painted on its cover. I bought it and pressed it onto my chest. This book was expensive for us then, yet nobody asked me to pay for it.<br />
Hey, Vova, remember how for several days we looked through the book and enjoyed its pictures and photos? We were fascinated by its colored plates at the end. I realized now that the paper on which it was printed was not that good, and that the photos were really painted graphics. Yet at that time, we were enchanted by it.<br />
One of the first beetles we saw in the book was a tiger beetle. I thought then it was a natural wonder difficult to find. Later, talking with some scientists at the University. we learned that tiger beetles were common in our forest. Our hopes grew bigger. I dreamed of this beetle, and our passion to catch one became an obsession.<br />
The picture depicted the beetle with green wings, bronze legs and terrifying jaws. We walked and walked kilometers, yet no beetle was found. One evening it was real hot and insects by the billions filled the air. It was such a festival of life! As if all of them were in a hurry to show there were alive.<br />
Our eyes looked out for any motion in the grass or on the branches of trees. Some events happen unexpectedly. I saw this strange green fly. However, instead of flying, it jumped from on place to another. It was a tiger beetle! The race after beetle had begun. We run along the forest edge. The beetle was captured and then sat in a jar. Our joy overfilled us. We talked about beetle and observed him carefully. That day we caught one more beetle and identified them as a pair. We decided keep them alive for observation. Mother gave us big jam jar. She said to us, &ldquo;You take all those bugs home for fun.&rdquo;<br />
We put some soil in the jar and fed our catch with worms. The opening of jar was covered with gauze. So we create a little world in a jar, a bit of that warm forest with happy toiling. Taking care of the beetles took off hours of our time. But it was a lot of fun. We put light above jar as a little sun and our beetles began to fly and ate its worms. Their frightening jaws cut worms as with a knife. Only the outside was left after dinner.<br />
Our observation ended unexpectedly. The beetles dug themselves in the soil. May be their life cycle ended this way. Mother thought our jar was a waste of time, but we kept more beetles in it. We also kept a small bug zoo with leeches and snails added.<br />
Years and years passed. Today, I have the impression that we all live in glass jars, well provided, though, with nice flooring, fridge for food, light on the ceiling, running water, far from sun and springs. How long would it take to really understand this idea?<br />
