<p>Next qualifying exam came insensible. I must to take open lesson for my coworkers. In free time I think about last innovations and my own abilities, reading books.<br />
Though, I worked not one year, feel obscure disturbance what became in tremor. My colleagues nice and pleasant with me but existed one more examiner what is very exacting to me &ndash; I&rsquo;m myself. He gave the most exact mark for my work and said unpleasant words.<br />
In my lesson pupils doing practical work: sitting in white bathrobes they pouring liquids in test-tubes and make multicolored &ldquo;compotes&rdquo;. My colleagues are satisfied with my work. Though, one more visitor among them who is more exacting then I&rsquo;m. This visitor is my Mother &ndash; teacher with 35-years experience period. She came on my lesson look about her son&rsquo;s work.<br />
After working day we are sitting in the little kitchen and discuss my job. She said with hidden envy: so, there are an excellent light in your school. In my time nobody take care about us so good. After these words we are fall silent and set aside our discussing.</p>
