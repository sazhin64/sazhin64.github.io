<p align="center">&nbsp;By Sergey Sazhin &ndash; 4 of August 2008<&#47;p><br />
I really enjoy this kind of relaxing sensation I feel when I stride through the forest. For me, this is tops. Yet, a modern busy Japanese man or New Russian will frown upon what they may consider a pastime only of those Nature lovers, who favor the quiet life of a sleepy village or even just his own garden.</p>
<p>Like most Russian regions, the Ural Mountains area&rsquo;s weather is unstable. If in the morning we expect sunrise, we get a drizzling rain instead. Every time my neighbor intends to go out to harvest hay, he will get a downpour.&nbsp; Really, weather does not like us most of the time</p>
<p>We also have frequent droughts especially in July &ndash; animals suffer and plants wither under the scorching heat.</p>
<p>I bear little resentment against weather &ndash; I look at it as an outsider. Since I do not cultivate the land or have not even a cow, weather to me is just another scenery. My friends do not agree with me. None of them likes rain, though, and I understand it.</p>
<p>In winter, I plan routes to visit old time beautiful places &hellip; favorite nooks enjoyed since I was a child. Among my dreams there is that picture I want to capture of crane flying over swamp near by. Years ago beavers inhabited our river, too. Yet, I have not been able to get them on camera either. But I will &ndash; eventually.</p>
<p>Such dreams help me endure a cold winter. I collect baits for future angling seasons. I store mosquito repellents and other useful stuff for a future vacation. From evening to evening I sit at the table to examine the baits, to remember the pikes I had caught and remember when I felt a strong fish wiggle in my arms.</p>
<p>It is great to recall the many different and unexpected emotions you get during a short and bright summer! For me, every summer is like a separate life. There is joy of life when experiencing the touch of nature and there is also melancholy when an irretrievable loss shows up, in all there happiness of luck and the tender loving care we feel for every living creature.</p>
<p>Every summer time I recall the noise of fledglings rustling in a nest under head of my bed in our old house. Enjoy the song of nightingales in June and the sad cry of the cranes in August. I see unknown things every time I walk through already known places.</p>
<p>Although my vacations are long, I begun to update my plans before the beginning of it. Neither rain nor wind can hold me home. It is a total nonsense to watch the rain behind a window glass at home. A really strong thunderstorm could hold me back, but not for long.</p>
<p>My grandfather used to tell me when I was a child that lightning struck metal, hence its sound. I remember his admonition all the time. I used to hold a milk can with bait. One day, a terrible thunderstorm caught up with me. I was really frightened. My grandfather yelled at me to crawl with the can across the meadow. I laugh now, but then I was scared out of my wits.</p>
<p>The rain nagged me more than the tears of an old woman crying about her youth. It made everything wet: grass, trees and soil. You walk along the road and your legs squelch the mud. The clothes got all wet from head to toes. This problem is something from the present. Cows used to eat all the grass, like lawn mowers. Today we have no cows and no peasants there. The grass grows up like a forest. My legs get tangled in the grass and I absorb all their water.</p>
<p>I have only one thought in my mind. How much milk and meat can be produced in this land? Cold weather and wet clothes bother me none.</p>
<p>When I was younger I worried about my clothes being wet, and I paid no attention to the surrounding beauty. Now, it is the other way around, I begin to sing a song of a famous group.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is autumn? Heaven!</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crying heaven under my legs...</p>
<p>Thus, I came in rhythm and ignore that I am soaking wet. Seven or eight kilometers were easily treaded. I automatically made a lot of dancing movements, rotation, steps, leaps.</p>
<p>I drag myself home. It is still raining, but I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Back home, I took my wet clothes off and relaxed blissfully. My winter plan was completed.</p>
