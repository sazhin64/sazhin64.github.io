    webmaster. I came to your \"The Clover Road From The Past  | &ETH;&iexcl;&ETH;&deg;&ETH;&sup1;&Ntilde;&sbquo;
    &ETH;&iexcl;&ETH;&micro;&Ntilde;&euro;&ETH;&sup3;&ETH;&micro;&Ntilde;\x8F &ETH;&iexcl;&ETH;&deg;&ETH;&para;&ETH;&cedil;&ETH;&frac12;&ETH;&deg;\"
    page via Google but it was difficult to find as you were not on the front page
    of search results. I see you could have more visitors because there are not many
    comments on your site yet. I have found a website which offers to dramatically
    increase your rankings and traffic to your site: http:&#47;&#47;www.linklegends.com&#47;free-trial.
    They managed to get close to 1000 visitors&#47;day using their services, you could
    also get lot more targeted visitors from search engines than you have now. I used
    their services and got significantly more traffic to my website. Hope this helps
    :) Take care. Mandi"

<p>I regret so much not to have had a good camera, Vova, when this picture you see here was shot for everyone to see. Everybody would enjoy today the bright and pastel colors of that time as if reliving the whole experience. But you and me share better pictures the ones taken by our minds, which preserve more than simple images, colors and shapes.</p>
<p>The pictures taken by our minds preserve sounds, and smell and touch and even the taste of an apple pie and that of fresh meaty fish fried in oil. We keep in those images, together with the colors, sounds, smells, tastes and touch, the fast beating of our hearts, the sadness or happiness in our souls. There are no photo albums large enough in this world to store so many complete images, like the ones you and I had stored deep inside our souls, images that will follow us through the rest of our lives. They will give us comfort and satisfaction as we grow older for a life well lived.</p>
<p>Yes, Vova, you may not have movie clips from that time, but the emotions we experienced when you were a kid will remain our friends forever. You have the option of drawing your own full color, full sensation pictures just out of your imagination.</p>
<p>I recall, Vova, when you were just a 10 year brat, curious and lively. I recall the times you were on summer vacations in our village. I remember Slava, the ever laughing boy, our neighbor, who hung around us all the time. Slava was a very jovial kid.</p>
<p>You two had such a contagious laugh, that I couldn&rsquo;t help laughing with you all the time. Slava used to drop by in the morning and whistled near our window, pulling you out of the sofa you enjoyed so much to lie on for hours.</p>
<p>We thought out things to do to entertain ourselves. One day, we decided to go to an abandoned village, where you could walked around and nobody would disturb you, and catch a rare species of butterfly, a machaon.</p>
<p>We walked along the road, singing as usual. At times, our laughter were so thundering that it scared birds away. Our noses welcomed the scent of linden&rsquo;s honey. The sun shone on our eyes. It was peaceful &ndash; no cars, no people, no anxieties.</p>
<p>I close my eyes today and I can see that road so vividly in my mind &mdash; do you remember? I can see you, Vova, with your butterfly net and I can hear you laughing out loud. I tried so hard to focus my camera on the butterflies, but you and Slava laughing shooed them away.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t see a machaon then, but we did see working ants crawling on top of an enormous anthill. Then we witnessed how future queens flew away to found new colonies. Slava said, &ldquo;They are going on vacation, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw a painted lady, but when I rushed to her to take her picture, the butterfly hid somewhere and I missed her. Then I began to feel so sad, seeing the rest of the abandoned village &mdash; walls covered with hogweeds growing wild where homes used to stand.</p>
<p>I felt depressed, but your laugh, boys, brought me back to wonderland. With wooden sticks as weapons we begin to slice the hogweed as modern samurais. We got exhausted. I had walked a long way.</p>
<p>Man is a strange creature. You find his trail everywhere. We sat on top of a clay hill and rested for a while. It was dinner time. My mother had baked a great apple pie and ate it up in a flash. We circled the village and avoided the hogweeds. We faced a spectacular meadow posing in front of our eyes. I worked my camera all the time to capture such beauty. We met a tractor driver, who stopped to give us a bottle of cool water from a nearby spring, and drove away after wishing us good luck.</p>
<p>We walked ahead. I took pictures and the boys chattering. Up a hill we went and looked back. My heart was pounding. My boys followed on the road, red by a carpet of red clover. The road snaked through the meadow to end up near the horizon. I was so happy, looking at you, guys having fun.</p>
<p>It was a gift to have such a day together. &ldquo;Where that red road will lead them in a future?&rdquo; I thought. Ten years later, I show some episodes to a friend, an artist. He was so enthralled with its beauty, he asked me for another one. I am on the same place again. My eyes detected the red road, where now only weeds grows. Cattle fed on clover while hogweed grows everywhere. I think it is about time that we laugh, sing and cry out loud, everything at the same time. We must think about our future. Our red road vanished. What lies ahead in our future then? Maybe our roads will be carpeted with weeds, maybe with asphalt.</p>
