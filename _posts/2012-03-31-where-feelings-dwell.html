<div>&nbsp;Imagined like one feature movie, Life is short and definite. Yet Life can be also long and tedious if you watch it like a soap opera &mdash; by long chapters. Decades are exposed in detail as a serial, in a series of short edited chapters. I am not dead to see life like a feature movie because in a film you see The End. I still watch life in never ending chapters &mdash; lots of them, though.Rerunning my past chapters depicting everyday problems I say to myself, &ldquo;Hey, dude, you are still young!&rdquo; This thought is an indicator of mental balance. Too much of anything is not good. Too much leisure brings anxiety about past and future. Extra chores may take some anxiety away, too many chores brings up exhaustion. My mental broadcasting, has a favorite serial, childhood. I never tire of its reruns.&nbsp; I repeat this program in my memory year after year. I see and feel again and again this village of mine in the Uralic forests, impregnated with a strong scent of mushroom and anthill formic acid.From the top of a hill, I see a meandering river going away at a distance. A flooded pastureland houses flocks of nightingales. The sun warms my country road. I walk barefoot playing with my feet in the dust. Near our home, young, squeaking jackdaw chicks wait in their nest in a hollow linden for their parents to feed them. Oh, my God! How many interesting and happy things surrounds a curious child! I realize that my imagination enhances reality. I may even take my imagination as real. After many years I begin to see myself as an outsider. I do not feel neither pain, despair nor melancholy or rancor from those years. I have forgiven my offenders &mdash; some of them are dead. New episodes are edited in. When I walk near places connected with my childhood reminiscences, I go back into my past to review memory clips. My memory pictures not fade with time; on the contrary, they became brighter and more touching.</p>
<p>My going-to-bed episodes help me have good dreams. They gave me power to fight the</p>
<p>depression that possesses me during the day. Those places, background for me to shoot my soap episodes, are inhabited by feelings, emotions, reactions &mdash; pure life.&nbsp; They exist independently from time, space, season or human mood. I fear only melancholy, which also lives in this realm. When I go there, I keep my eyes open and wait for an attack of sadness. Oh! See that tree? I used to climb it when I was seven. Memories covered me from head to toes. Warm tears slid down my face to fall on the grass and cling on their blades like dew. When I relax I feel easy. I feel like flying over the meadows, rivers and fields. Since I do not tire, I can go far, far away. I fly all over the earth needing neither food nor water.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many tests one must pass in a lifetime. One can have endless experiences, if one has a place on Earth inhabited by love and memory &mdash; a place you visit with riding the vehicle of your mind. Another special episode hides there; this is not that long. It is a short film. Its plot is about mutual understanding between father and son. Boys like to spend time with their fathers. A boy who does this is happy! And his father is also happy because he receives the gift of freedom, elbowroom, warmth, and the scent of honey, grass, colorful flowers and silver fish. This is a short, explosive period of life. Melancholy lives, too, and some real pains that alerted me about the future. A weird&nbsp; discomfort pricks my heart in the best places in my life. There are bird and cherry tree and moments together with my young son.</p>
<p>Last year I tried visiting places uninhabited yet with feelings. I can walk in peace in my mind. I relax and saw flowers, butterflies and landscapes and unborn feelings.</p>
<p>My skin has grown thicker and lost sensitivity. Yet I not feel hungry, achy or tired when I breathe in the smell of grass. I can go as long as the road under my feet, as long as my favorite river. For moments, I live in a different dimension. Now I go to work, but I never arrive there. Instead, I can lie still in this nook of Earth where happiness lives.</p>
