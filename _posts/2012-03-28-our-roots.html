<p>We all have moments when we need to fulfill goals, achievements and daily chores to add on our vital energy. Where do we find it? I find them in those places that reflect the most the spirit of our motherland, those places we appreciate the most.</p>
<p>I came to be on Earth for the first time on this little village, like many others. However my place of birth was a unique experience for me &mdash; no pollution and no contamination. Rivers and brooks house many fishes, and their water is tasty fresh.</p>
<p>I love places with a small combination of smells, tastes and sounds that form part of the human beings native to these places. The whole makes our hearts beat faster as if it would like to jump out of our chest.</p>
<p>Grandma Faina Mikhailovna and grandpa Grygory Vasilievich Sazhin are very strong folks. They had a hard time in life, and I often question, &ldquo;Where do they pull that energy from?&rdquo; What makes them tick? Everybody knows that country life is not for everybody. Yet, my grandparents wouldn&rsquo;t it change it for nothing.</p>
<p>A few years ago, my mother Tamara Grigorievna and I decided to go to our place of origin. We wanted to breathe again the air of our youth. We met many obstacles in our plans &mdash; lack of money, no jobs. But two years ago, everything got better and on we went to our grandpa&rsquo;s village.</p>
<p>Only three wooden houses remained from the Ekateinovka village, in the Uinsky district of the Permian region. One feels depressed that a rich land that can feed several hundred people became idle. Grandpa&rsquo;s family is composed of beekeepers. The house of our ancestors is still inhabited: A beekeeper and his family lives there. He attended the Permian Pedagogical University Apiary. Our guide&rsquo;s name is Dmitry &mdash; quite a handsome dude. He shows us the house and its surrounding. Then he unscrewed a hook from the ceiling, where in the past cradles were place to rock. Maybe my uncles rock from it!</p>
<p>We came back home loaded with feelings from the past: Melancholy and content. I fail to understand why that land tainted with blood during the civil war has been abandoned. Would it be that some topnotch politician would like Russia to become uninhabited and barren? Most teenagers hate their villages and dream of going away to the big cities. We saw the results of our education everywhere, dead lakes, polluted waters and acid-poisoned soils. Of course, the country people living there curse their land.</p>
<p>Then, we went to visit the place where our grandma was born, a little village called Chernushka, in the same district. Every year we planned and planned this trip, but never made it. I found a good map on the Internet, discussed our route and even dream of it. Good roads are a problem. We had to ask someone with a country-ready vehicle to take us there.</p>
<p>It was a splendid day of a dying September. We rush on to fulfill our dream. We asked the car owner to stop at every place we thought beautiful enough to take a picture. We also stopped to ask the people about our final stop. Nobody really knew exactly where our village was. Our driver kept on going, the car jumped frequently when hitting the bumps of the road. We enjoy the sight of mounts, meadows and ploughed fields.</p>
<p>We spotted a needle on a mound, near a tall pine. We asked, &ldquo;What is that&rdquo;? We went up and read the names of two dozen of those soldiers who went to fight from the Muravievka village during the WW II.&nbsp; No other trace remained from the village, just this monument. We checked the map and corrected our route. The road went through mountains dotted with mixed trees.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;sergei-sazhin.ru&#47;?attachment_id=662" rel="attachment wp-att-662"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-662" title="Изображение 011" src="http:&#47;&#47;sergei-sazhin.ru&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2012&#47;03&#47;Изображение-011-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="397" height="300" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>When we reached the top of the mountain, a splendid picture displayed itself before our eyes. The village lay below among bushes and majestic birches. A wooden church still stood at the entrance, but the village is dead.</p>
<p>We did not expect that sight: We thought there were people still living there. On the 1986 map, it is shown as inhabited. We hoped to find anybody who could know the place where our grandma lived. Our car went on in our quest. The white marsh is the source of three rivers, the Tuy, Tulva and Tart. The road is now even worse, only a path across the field. We see elks, and cranes flying above. There are short pines standing on the moss. Juicy red <em>berries<&#47;em> tempt us.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;sergei-sazhin.ru&#47;?attachment_id=659" rel="attachment wp-att-659"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-659" title="Изображение 029" src="http:&#47;&#47;sergei-sazhin.ru&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2012&#47;03&#47;-029-e1332931297627-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="778" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>Finally! We reached our goal &mdash; we found our fairy place, the cradle of my childhood! We got some natural jewels, a handful of moose berry, and great pictures for the family album. I imagine a young grandma collecting berries with her friends. We wanted to bring back some and give them out to friends and relatives.</p>
<p>This story may not be finished because I cannot read the mental reaction of every relative we gave a berry.</p>
