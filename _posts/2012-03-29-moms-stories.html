<p>Sometimes our extended family sits around the dinner table for a story telling session. All the stories are hilarious and we all laughed our heads off. However, despite the many times I heard them, it never occurred to me to write them down.<br />
My mother is the best storyteller from us all. She is a professional teacher in literature. Her stories are picturesque with unexpected ending. I recall some of her short stories and anecdotes, especially those from her early life. Here you have some of them.</p>
<p><strong>Flies on her blouse.<&#47;strong><br />
In 1955, my mother studied in the Permian Pedagogical Institute. She was a slender girl, who showed an independent character.. Her classmates were heterogeneous in age and social status. Some girls had rural roots, yet two or three of them were from the city and were very proud about it.<br />
Urban girls overdressed and refused to associate with country people.<br />
My mother&rsquo;s friend, Svetlana, studied in her group and was a physical education teacher in little village. Although Svetlana had an active mind and loved jokes, she had some learning difficulties, especially, learning Dutch, a subject my Mom did great. Although today, she remembers just of couple of words, for lack of practice. Yet, still her friends ask her to help with their Dutch grammar.<br />
There was this good looking yet obnoxious woman, who asked Mom to help her out, but she did not even thank her. The tone of this woman&rsquo;s voice was rude and demanding. My mother and Svletana decided to teach the woman a lesson.<br />
Svetlana and Mom sat behind their victim in the next class. The woman was showing off the fancy white dress she was wearing over her big fat ass. She was teasing the other girls as a bullfighter teases the bull with a red cloth.<br />
Svetlana caught a fly in midair, pulled its wind off and put it on the woman&rsquo;s white dress. She did it again and again, until everybody couldn&rsquo;t stop laughing at the sight and the teacher had to call to order.</p>
<p><strong>The horse in the shit<&#47;strong><br />
This event happened in 1945 when my mother was teenager. She lived with her parents and two sisters in an apartment of a building attached to the hospital. Grandpa worked at that hospital while his family lived nearby in our village<br />
At that time some people reached the hospital by horse or on foot, because there were not many cars. They used outhouse during whole year. There were holes on the building walls through which a constant blowing wind whistled.<br />
Grandma took care of her vegetables and did not allow animals in our garden. She held a long stick in her hand and stood guard near the seedbeds.<br />
One peasant arrived at the hospital, and tied his horse near our garden. The horse was too close to the vegetables and to the outhouse. Grandmother took her stick and sneak up to the horse from the back. She did not realize that the horse was tied.<br />
Grandmother gave a good hit on the horse. The poor animal and pitiful animal ripped his tether and started to jump around and, by accident, hit our outhouse and sank into the excrements. Grandma was scared and Mom began to call people to help. Grandma couldn&rsquo;t utter a word.<br />
  People gathered in our yard to look on horse bathing in the excrement. They laughed and pointed at him. It was hard to drag a horse out a whole filled with human feces. Some courageous guys tried, but their effort ended with laugh and mockery.<br />
Lastly, they took a thick and broad board, set it under horse&rsquo;s abdomen and tried to lift him up. Some pushed on the other end of the board. The horse has moved up from the stench of human waste. Finally, the horse jumped out of the pit, showering everybody around with soupy feces on its way up. The owner of the horse asked children to bather the animal in the river.</p>
<p><strong>The pediatrician&rsquo;s watch<&#47;strong><br />
During Second World War, they founded an orphanage in our village. A pediatrician by the name of Rabinovitch worked there. At that time, every healthy man was inducted. But Rabinovitch was Jewish. He refused to go to war, and worked in heartland.<br />
He lived in little house with no facilities and he had to use the back of the house as his bathroom. A heap of shit accumulated in winter.<br />
One day, he went to have a shit on his private mound.<br />
Wanting to check the time, he took a peek at his watch, and this had disappeared. He looked all over, underneath &mdash; nothing but a pile of shit. He asked a peasant for help and nothing. Only after spring came, he could find the watch. </p>
