  content: ". A good example of what you are saying is a rule that says soldiers are
    not allowed to kill taliban that are planting explosives at night. Wod9#n&amp;u3l;t
    want to disturb the locals. Because of that crazy rule, our men in uniform have
    died. Its Political Correctness run amok. Yes its time to get out. And just like
    in Vietnam where we won all the battles, we still lost the war."

<p>As a child you probably read Mark Twain&rsquo;s first novel The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. That book makes me think that we sometimes need to read children&rsquo;s literature again. Those books have a lot of things to teach grownups, too, because they are a spring of wisdom that never dries. How can we trick somebody into doing a job and make him happy at the same time? If the money earned does not stretch out to suit our needs enough to please a drunken locksmith, what can we do?<br />
We must think about these things before we start doing something. There is glory, for instance. How about making yourself immortal with a tree you plant yourself? How about the first tree planted in a line of trees being yours? Next get a spade, a watering can, and some seedlings. Now you are ready for the job, while someone holds the camera ready to capture your image for posterity. That is all you need!<br />
Now sit back and relax. Rarely you will need to ask someone else to plant the second tree. It is so simple, especially with children, just fuel in them the motive of competition in many ways: Who will be the one who plant more seedlings? Change the scenery. Now we need to pick up wastepaper. Who will get more paper, the forth graders or the fifth graders? You bet that if forth graders store the most, next time sixth graders, for instance, will do their best to be the winners.<br />
Another scenery: a garden with flowerbeds. Give their teachers the seeds and they in time will promise rewards for the job best done. We show them last year&rsquo;s photos of the winners. The next year, the contest will unfold itself. Students will bring their own seeds, requesting a small garden plot or bed.<br />
Our own example is their best motivation. Two years ago I brought several lilies of the valley from my region 400 miles away. On my way from home to our job site, I thought of they would react to my surprise, but it was me, who received the bigger surprise &mdash; the school headmaster had brought in the same kind of flower! The same day the children and we planted the flowers.<br />
We all hope that passersby would not only appreciate our work but also protect it. When the parents came to our school they were pleasantly surprised by the job carried out by their children &mdash; it was their first time.</p>
