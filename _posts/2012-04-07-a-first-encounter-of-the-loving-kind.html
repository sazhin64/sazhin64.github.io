<p><strong><&#47;strong>My son Vova had his heart touch by a charming girl while studying together two weeks ago at the University. She gave him that overwhelming feeling that possesses us all at one time during our youth &mdash; a paradoxically sensation that takes over our minds and with the sweetest rewards is capable of driving us ravenous mad.</p>
<p>That happened to him. In was planted inside his being and it grew in fertile terrain. I thought, &ldquo;poor son of mine, he is been possessed, now he won&rsquo;t be able to think about anything else, but about his sweet love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After he told me all about her and analyzed his confession. As a biologist I evaluated his girl and qualified her as an alpha-person in human population. She is an attractive redhead, who enjoys being the center of attention.</p>
<p>I said to him, &ldquo;Vova, I do not think she will do it for you because you are too timid. Girls like her love men of character. If you want to conquer her, be more assertive and stronger.&ldquo;</p>
<p>He answered like your typical young man in love, &ldquo;That is my business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vova is my only son; I felt sorry for him. He is not eating as he used to, and he is not sleeping well either in two weeks. Then he has become withdrawn. Neither his mother nor I could get a word of him.</p>
<p>Then I learned what happened to him. The students were at a birthday party celebrating and after taking a few drinks Vova thought it was the right moment to open up to that redhead that captivated his heat. He did and she laughed at him and told him to go to hell.</p>
<p>Next morning I saw him, and he was injured. I asked him, &ldquo;What on earth happened to you?&rdquo; He confessed, &ldquo;I broke my arm hitting the way after she mocked me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The time is a good remedy. And youth speeds that recovery up. Vova is young and the fact that it was his first love disappoint, the word &ldquo;first&rdquo; was a surge giveaway that there are going to be a few more. Also the cure is around the corner looking at him with bright eyes.</p>
<p>For a while, he tried to get in touch with his beloved redhead, until one day he met on line another charming girl who wrote to him from a neighboring city six hours away. She was well mannered, pretty and told him she planned to visit our city. Vova broke his silence and asked me some allowance to get ready to welcome his new friends.</p>
<p>She rented a room for two days in the other end of city. I was worry for him and maybe I thought about it too much. He came back home clean as a whistle and then I could hear a quiet melody from his guitar. Next morning he woke up early, took a guitar and went out.</p>
<p>Vova and his girl sat on the bench near pond in the center and played his guitar. There are musicians there playing their instruments. Passersby smile and drop coins on the guitar cover.</p>
<p>He came home, changed his clothes and we spent some time together.</p>
<p>She left by bus and six hours later they were writing on line &mdash; I heard his fingers clicking on the keyboard.</p>
<p>At dinnertime, we all ate like horses. Everything went back to normal.</p>
