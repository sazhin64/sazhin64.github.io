<p>When I was young, my boss often sent me on business trips. It worked well because at that time I was single, and I had no one waiting for me at home, no wife, no kids, and not pets.&nbsp; A very cold New Year Eve I was asked to go in a rush business trip. So, I needed to take al my winter clothes out of the closet where they were safely packed with naphthalene tablets to prevent voracious moths to gnaw it away. As you know, naphthalene makes a great moth repellent, but it has a very strong smell.<br />
Locked up in the closet for too long my clothes absorbed the smell. It was really strong. I<br />
took my fur coat out of the closet. My nose resisted that abominable smell by holding the air out. I was squeezing my brains to come up with something to fight back that smell. I opted to spray the coat with cologne &mdash; bad idea.<br />
When I walked in the office, I smelled terrible, and everybody looked at me and covered<br />
their noses.&nbsp; In my boss&rsquo; office, his secretary called me, &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; maybe because she thought I was wearing on myself a poor smelling, cheap cologne, not the mixture of naphthalene and cologne I put on the coat. Recalling the event back, I have to laugh, especially because now I find it to be a funny thing the fact that while I was waiting for my boss to arrive, all the women got out of the room. Then when I was leaving, I heard them opening the windows and laughing out loud.</p>
